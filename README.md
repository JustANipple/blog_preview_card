## My process

### Built with

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Flutter docs
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides) - Dart docs

### What I learned

I tried for the first time to build a project with Flutter. The idea of building an app that works on every platform interests me, so i tried to do something simple, but it was still challenging
I learned a lot just by trying to centralize styling, adding responsiveness and trying to make everything as a widget

### Continued development

Next time i'd like to make some transition and animation on user action

### Useful resources

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) - These docs have nice interactive guides to get started with Flutter features to handle layout, responsiveness, animation and transitions
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - This is the base of Flutter
